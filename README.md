# Phuket-Hotel-Booking-Project

Overview
This project contains a collection of projects and analyses that demonstrate my skills as a data scientist and data analyst. 
This project showcases my ability to handle real-world data, extract valuable insights, and build predictive models.

Project Highlights:
Objective: Analyze hotel booking data to uncover patterns and insights that can optimize business operations.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
Machine Learning (ARIMA Model)
Findings: Discovered top guest origin countries, market segments, and room preferences. Conducted time series analysis to predict future guest arrivals.

Data Analysis:

Analyzed various aspects of the data, including:
- Where guests come from (top countries).
- Differences between reserved and assigned room types.
- The highest booking market segment.
- Average price per night (ADR) of various room types for different market segments.
- Total guests' arrival on each day and identified patterns.

Time Series Analysis:
- Performed time series analysis on the guest arrival data.
- Conducted the Dickey-Fuller test to check for stationarity and performed differencing to make the data stationary.
- Built an ARIMA model to make predictions about future guest arrivals.
