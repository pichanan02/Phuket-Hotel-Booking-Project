# Phuket-Hotel-Booking-Project

Overview:
This portfolio represents a comprehensive collection of data science and data analysis projects that highlight my proficiency in handling real-world data, extracting meaningful insights, and constructing predictive models. Throughout this project, I have demonstrated a strong skill set in various aspects of data analysis, from data cleaning and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series analysis, and machine learning.


Project Highlights:
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to uncover hidden patterns and valuable insights that can be leveraged to optimize business operations within the hotel industry.


Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted extensive EDA to gain a deep understanding of the dataset, uncover trends, and identify potential areas for analysis.
- Time Series Analysis and Forecasting: I applied time series analysis techniques to analyze guest arrival data and utilized the ARIMA model to make predictions about future guest arrivals.


Findings:
- I identified the top countries from which guests originate, allowing for targeted marketing efforts.
- By comparing reserved and assigned room types, I provided insights into room allocation and preferences.
- I pinpointed the most prominent booking market segment, aiding in marketing and pricing strategies.
- Calculated the average price per night (ADR) for various room types across different market segments.
- I analyzed the total number of guests arriving each day and identified patterns that could inform staffing and resource allocation decisions.


Data Analysis:
I conducted in-depth analyses on various facets of the dataset, including guest origin, room preferences, market segments, and pricing strategies.


Time Series Analysis:
- I performed a rigorous time series analysis on guest arrival data.
- Utilizing the Dickey-Fuller test, I assessed data stationarity and applied differencing to achieve stationarity.
- I developed an ARIMA model to provide accurate predictions regarding future guest arrivals.


This project serves as a testament to my data science and data analysis skills, showcasing my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets and provide actionable recommendations for business improvement.
